Final Sem Assignment Ticketing System (Data Structure)

THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TASK

We are required to write a program flight ticket booking system with a queue for waiting list
with the following requirements:

1. Search for flights in any week. The user should be able to search for a flight in any week,
i.e., the program must be able to book tickets for not just 1 flight, but many flights in 1
week (for example, we choose 19th November 2018 – 25th November 2018). For
simplicity, assume that all the flights fly between the same destinations and there is no
need to ask the user for the departure and arrival destinations.
2. Book a ticket. 1 seat shall be booked in each booking.
- If there is a vacant seat in the flight, book the seat and add the passenger to the
confirmed tickets’ list.
- If there is no vacancy, add the passenger to a waiting list.
3. Edit ticket information. The user able to edit the information of the passenger such as
passengers’ name, passport number etc. in the ticket.
4. View ticket status (confirmed/waiting list). The user able to view the status of his/her
ticket.

5. Cancel a ticket. When a ticket is cancelled, if there is any he/she passenger in the waiting
list, the first passenger in the waiting list must be removed from the waiting list and must
be added to the confirmed tickets’ list.
